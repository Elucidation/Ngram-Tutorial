# IPython Notebook - N-gram Tutorial

*By Sam Ansari - Aug 13, 2015*

First I'll see how far I can get with N-grams without outside resources

We have a text file for [Pride and Prejudice from Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342) stored as `pg1342.txt` in the same folder as our notebook. Let's load the text to a string since it's only 701KB, which will fit in memory nowadays. 

    *Note* : If we wanted to be more memory efficient we should parse the text file and store per word, etc.


    with open('pg1342.txt', 'r') as f:
        txt = f.read()
    
    # See the number of characters and the first 50 characters to confirm it is there    
    print len(txt), ',', txt[:50] , '...'

Great, now lets split into words into a big list, splitting on anything non-alphanumeric [A-Za-z0-9] (as well as punctuation) and forcing everything lowercase


    import re
    words = re.split('[^A-Za-z]+', txt.lower())
    words = filter(None, words) # Remove empty strings
    
    # Print length of list
    print len(words)
    
    

    125897
    

## Sets
From this we can now generate N-grams, lets start with a 1-gram, basically the set of all the words

    *Note* : One could use a dictionary instead of a set and keeping count of the occurances gives word frequency


    import sets
    
    # Create set of all unique words, this throws away any information about frequency however
    gram1 = set(words)
    
    print len(gram1)
    
    # Instead of printing all the elements in the set, create an iterator and print 20 elements only
    gram1_iter = iter(gram1)
    print [gram1_iter.next() for i in xrange(20)]

    6528
    ['foul', 'four', 'woods', 'hanging', 'woody', 'looking', 'eligible', 'scold', 'lord', 'meadows', 'sinking', 'leisurely', 'bringing', 'disturb', 'recollections', 'wednesday', 'piling', 'persisted', 'succession', 'tired']
    

Lets try and get the 2-gram now, which is pairs of words. Let's have a quick look to see the last 10 and how they look.


    # See the last 10 pairs
    for i in xrange(len(words)-10, len(words)-1):
        print words[i], words[i+1]

    about new
    new ebooks
    

Okay, seems good, lets get all word pairs, and then generate a set of unique pairs from it


    word_pairs = [(words[i], words[i+1]) for i in xrange(len(words)-1)]
    print len(word_pairs)
    
    gram2 = set(word_pairs)
    print len(gram2)
    
    # Print 20 elements from gram2
    gram2_iter = iter(gram2)
    print [gram2_iter.next() for i in xrange(20)]

    125896
    55636
    [('her', 'taste'), ('every', 'kind'), ('five', 'shillings'), ('soothed', 'but'), ('seemed', 'most'), ('fortune', 'it'), ('of', 'thanking'), ('near', 'she'), ('understand', 'from'), ('it', 'looks'), ('have', 'made'), ('lucas', 'he'), ('fail', 'him'), ('new', 'to'), ('nothing', 'but'), ('fearful', 'on'), ('to', 'wander'), ('write', 'rather'), ('of', 'studying'), ('interruption', 'from')]
    

## Frequency

Okay, that was fun, but this isn't enough, we need frequency if we want to have any sense of probabilities, which is what N-grams are about. Instead of using sets, lets create a dictionary with counts


    gram1 = dict()
    
    # Populate 1-gram dictionary
    for word in words:
        if gram1.has_key(word):
            gram1[word] += 1
        else:
            gram1[word] = 1 # Start a new entry with 1 count since saw it for the first time.
    
    # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least
    gram1 = sorted(gram1.items(), key=lambda (word, count): -count)
    
    # Print top 20 most frequent words
    print gram1[:20]

    [('the', 4507), ('to', 4243), ('of', 3730), ('and', 3658), ('her', 2225), ('i', 2070), ('a', 2012), ('in', 1937), ('was', 1847), ('she', 1710), ('that', 1594), ('it', 1550), ('not', 1450), ('you', 1428), ('he', 1339), ('his', 1271), ('be', 1260), ('as', 1192), ('had', 1177), ('with', 1100)]
    

For Pride and Prejudice, the words 'the', 'to', 'of', and 'and' were the top four most common words. Sounds about right, not too interesting yet, lets see what happens with 2-grams.


    gram2 = dict()
    
    # Populate 2-gram dictionary
    for i in xrange(len(words)-1):
        key = (words[i], words[i+1])
        if gram2.has_key(key):
            gram2[key] += 1
        else:
            gram2[key] = 1
    
    # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least
    gram2 = sorted(gram2.items(), key=lambda (_, count): -count)
    
    # Print top 20 most frequent words
    print gram2[:20]

    [(('of', 'the'), 491), (('to', 'be'), 445), (('in', 'the'), 397), (('i', 'am'), 303), (('mr', 'darcy'), 273), (('to', 'the'), 268), (('of', 'her'), 261), (('it', 'was'), 251), (('of', 'his'), 235), (('she', 'was'), 212), (('she', 'had'), 205), (('had', 'been'), 200), (('it', 'is'), 194), (('i', 'have'), 188), (('to', 'her'), 179), (('that', 'he'), 177), (('could', 'not'), 167), (('he', 'had'), 166), (('and', 'the'), 165), (('for', 'the'), 163)]
    

It looks like `"of the"` and `"to be"` are the top two most common 2-grams, sounds good. 

## Next word prediction
What can we do with this? Well lets see what happens if we take a random word from all the words, and build a sentence by just choosing the most common pair that has that word as it's start.


    start_word = words[len(words)/4]
    print start_word

    enough
    

I just went ahead and chose the word that appears $1/4$ of the way into words, random enough.

Now in a loop, iterate through the frequency list (most frequent first) and see if it matches the first word in a pair, if so, the next word is the second element in the word pair, and continue with that word. Stop after N words or the list does not contain that word.

    *Note* : gram2 is a list that contains (key,value) where key is a word pair (first, second),
             so you need element[0][0] for first word and element [0][1] for second word


    def get2GramSentence(word, n = 50):
        for i in xrange(n):
            print word,
            # Find Next word
            word = next((element[0][1] for element in gram2 if element[0][0] == word), None)
            if not word:
                break
    
    word = start_word
    print "Start word: %s" % word
    
    print "2-gram sentence: \"",
    get2GramSentence(word, 20)
    print "\""

    Start word: enough
    2-gram sentence: " enough to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much "
    

It gets stuck in a loop pretty much straight away. Not very interesting, try out other words and see what happens.


    for word in ['and', 'he', 'she', 'when', 'john', 'never', 'i', 'how']:
        print "Start word: %s" % word
    
        print "2-gram sentence: \"",
        get2GramSentence(word, 20)
        print "\""

    Start word: and
    2-gram sentence: " and the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the "
    Start word: he
    2-gram sentence: " he had been so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much "
    Start word: she
    2-gram sentence: " she was not be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so "
    Start word: when
    2-gram sentence: " when she was not be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be "
    Start word: john
    2-gram sentence: " john with the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of "
    Start word: never
    2-gram sentence: " never be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as "
    Start word: i
    2-gram sentence: " i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am "
    Start word: how
    2-gram sentence: " how much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be "
    

## Weighted random choice based on frequency
Same thing. Okay, lets randomly choose from the subset of all 2grams that matches the first word, using a weighted-probability based on counts.


    import random
    def weighted_choice(choices):
       total = sum(w for c, w in choices)
       r = random.uniform(0, total)
       upto = 0
       for c, w in choices:
          if upto + w > r:
             return c
          upto += w
        
    def get2GramSentenceRandom(word, n = 50):
        for i in xrange(n):
            print word,
            # Get all possible elements ((first word, second word), frequency)
            choices = [element for element in gram2 if element[0][0] == word]
            if not choices:
                break
            
            # Choose a pair with weighted probability from the choice list
            word = weighted_choice(choices)[1]


    for word in ['and', 'he', 'she', 'when', 'john', 'never', 'i', 'how']:
        print "Start word: %s" % word
    
        print "2-gram sentence: \"",
        get2GramSentenceRandom(word, 20)
        print "\""

    Start word: and
    2-gram sentence: " and almost have allowed her model of her letter and goodness oh cried elizabeth this event of several years of "
    Start word: he
    2-gram sentence: " he chiefly in oh lizzy continued i could he had been really amiable light as well and within her brother "
    Start word: she
    2-gram sentence: " she is very gentleness as well as usual with this agreement shall never more have long and though it not "
    Start word: when
    2-gram sentence: " when he was not justify the world who are very kind from something was bestowed on looking up the loss "
    Start word: john
    2-gram sentence: " john with cold was first stage of dignity with the letter was convinced from much in the ball at all "
    Start word: never
    2-gram sentence: " never let me jane to her going there but i do not to the most likely that whatever his reserve "
    Start word: i
    2-gram sentence: " i had one of self destined for you must feel the project gutenberg volunteers and of an unpleasant sort of "
    Start word: how
    2-gram sentence: " how many weeks and loving them though it is tolerably till the neighbourhood it to equal to elizabeth could not "
    

**Now that's way more interesting!** Those are starting to look like sentences!

    *Note* It's pretty interesting to see that for the sentence " when he believed him from the amiable but mrs hurst s being ill of being the discussion of course of ", we have hurst s, which we can tell came from Hurst's, an artifact of our stripping away all punctuation but keeping the s.

Let's try a longer sentence


    word = 'it'
    print "Start word: %s" % word
    print "2-gram sentence: \"",
    get2GramSentenceRandom(word, 50)
    print "\""

    Start word: it
    2-gram sentence: " it would be the netherfield for whatever might see mr and show off two years had at dinner was banished and by her inquiries about it was unluckily for my own fault with an unforgiving speech they proposed being married and address that mr denny himself on mr bennet s "
    

Pretty cool, lets see what happens when we go to N-grams above 2.
## Tri-grams and more
Okay, let's create a Ngram generator that can let us make ngrams of arbitrary sizes


    def generateNgram(n=1):
        gram = dict()
        
        # Some helpers to keep us crashing the PC for now
        assert n > 0 and n < 20
        
        # Populate N-gram dictionary
        for i in xrange(len(words)-(n-1)):
            key = tuple(words[i:i+n])
            if gram.has_key(key):
                gram[key] += 1
            else:
                gram[key] = 1
    
        # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least
        gram = sorted(gram.items(), key=lambda (_, count): -count)
        return gram
    
    trigram = generateNgram(3)
    # Print top 20 most frequent ngrams
    print trigram[:20]

    [(('i', 'do', 'not'), 62), (('i', 'am', 'sure'), 62), (('project', 'gutenberg', 'tm'), 57), (('as', 'soon', 'as'), 55), (('she', 'could', 'not'), 50), (('that', 'he', 'had'), 37), (('in', 'the', 'world'), 34), (('it', 'would', 'be'), 34), (('i', 'am', 'not'), 32), (('i', 'dare', 'say'), 31), (('the', 'project', 'gutenberg'), 31), (('could', 'not', 'be'), 30), (('it', 'was', 'not'), 30), (('that', 'he', 'was'), 29), (('mr', 'darcy', 's'), 29), (('that', 'it', 'was'), 28), (('on', 'the', 'subject'), 28), (('as', 'well', 'as'), 27), (('would', 'have', 'been'), 27), (('of', 'mr', 'darcy'), 27)]
    

Cool! Okay, let's see a selection of sentences for N-grams with N = 2 to 10 and a few starting words!


    def getNGramSentenceRandom(gram, word, n = 50):
        for i in xrange(n):
            print word,
            # Get all possible elements ((first word, second word), frequency)
            choices = [element for element in gram if element[0][0] == word]
            if not choices:
                break
            
            # Choose a pair with weighted probability from the choice list
            word = weighted_choice(choices)[1]
    for n in xrange(2,10):
        # Generate ngram list
        print
        print "Generating %d-gram list..." % n,
        ngram = generateNgram(n)
        print "Done"
        
        # Try out a bunch of sentences
        for word in ['and', 'he', 'she', 'when', 'john', 'never', 'i', 'how']:
            print "  %d-gram: \"" % n,
            getNGramSentenceRandom(ngram, word, 15)

You can clearly see the sentences getting better and better with larger n-grams, this correlates to the ngram having more foresight into the sentence structure.


    # Generate 10gram list

    gram10 = generateNgram(10)

Let's play with the 10gram and see what sort of sentence comes out.

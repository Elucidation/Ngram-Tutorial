Let's load the text to a string since it's only 701KB, which will fit in memory nowadays. \r\n\r\n    *Note* : If we wanted to be more memory efficient we should parse the text file and store per word, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    with open('pg1342.txt', 'r') as f:\r\n        txt = f.read()\r\n    \r\n    # See the number of characters and the first 50 characters to confirm it is there    \r\n    print len(txt), ',', txt[:50] , '...'\r\n\r\n    704149 , ï»¿The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejud ...\r\n    \r\n\r\nGreat, now lets split into words into a big list, splitting on anything non-alphanumeric [A-Za-z0-9] (as well as punctuation) and forcing everything lowercase\r\n\r\n\r\n    words = re.split('[^A-Za-z]+', txt.lower())\r\n    words = filter(None, words) # Remove empty strings\r\n    \r\n    # Print length of list\r\n    print len(words)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n    125897\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Sets\r\nFrom this we can now generate N-grams, lets start with a 1-gram, basically the set of all the words\r\n\r\n    *Note* : One could use a dictionary instead of a set and keeping count of the occurances gives word frequency\r\n\r\n\r\n    import sets\r\n    \r\n    # Create set of all unique words, this throws away any information about frequency however\r\n    gram1 = set(words)\r\n    \r\n    print len(gram1)\r\n    \r\n    # Instead of printing all the elements in the set, create an iterator and print 20 elements only\r\n    gram1_iter = iter(gram1)\r\n    print [gram1_iter.next() for i in xrange(20)]\r\n\r\n    6528\r\n    ['foul', 'four', 'woods', 'hanging', 'woody', 'looking', 'eligible', 'scold', 'lord', 'meadows', 'sinking', 'leisurely', 'bringing', 'disturb', 'recollections', 'wednesday', 'piling', 'persisted', 'succession', 'tired']\r\n    \r\n\r\nLets try and get the 2-gram now, which is pairs of words. Let's have a quick look to see the last 10 and how they look.\r\n\r\n\r\n    # See the last 10 pairs\r\n    for i in xrange(len(words)-10, len(words)-1):\r\n        print words[i], words[i+1]\r\n\r\n    subscribe to\r\n    to our\r\n    our email\r\n    email newsletter\r\n    newsletter to\r\n    to hear\r\n    hear about\r\n    about new\r\n    new ebooks\r\n    \r\n\r\nOkay, seems good, lets get all word pairs, and then generate a set of unique pairs from it\r\n\r\n\r\n    word_pairs = [(words[i], words[i+1]) for i in xrange(len(words)-1)]\r\n    print len(word_pairs)\r\n    \r\n    gram2 = set(word_pairs)\r\n    print len(gram2)\r\n    \r\n    # Print 20 elements from gram2\r\n    gram2_iter = iter(gram2)\r\n    print [gram2_iter.next() for i in xrange(20)]\r\n\r\n    125896\r\n    55636\r\n    [('her', 'taste'), ('every', 'kind'), ('five', 'shillings'), ('soothed', 'but'), ('seemed', 'most'), ('fortune', 'it'), ('of', 'thanking'), ('near', 'she'), ('understand', 'from'), ('it', 'looks'), ('have', 'made'), ('lucas', 'he'), ('fail', 'him'), ('new', 'to'), ('nothing', 'but'), ('fearful', 'on'), ('to', 'wander'), ('write', 'rather'), ('of', 'studying'), ('interruption', 'from')]\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Frequency\r\n\r\nOkay, that was fun, but this isn't enough, we need frequency if we want to have any sense of probabilities, which is what N-grams are about. Instead of using sets, lets create a dictionary with counts\r\n\r\n\r\n    gram1 = dict()\r\n    \r\n    # Populate 1-gram dictionary\r\n    for word in words:\r\n        if gram1.has_key(word):\r\n            gram1[word] += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            gram1[word] = 1 # Start a new entry with 1 count since saw it for the first time.\r\n    \r\n    # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least\r\n    gram1 = sorted(gram1.items(), key=lambda (word, count): -count)\r\n    \r\n    # Print top 20 most frequent words\r\n    print gram1[:20]\r\n\r\n    [('the', 4507), ('to', 4243), ('of', 3730), ('and', 3658), ('her', 2225), ('i', 2070), ('a', 2012), ('in', 1937), ('was', 1847), ('she', 1710), ('that', 1594), ('it', 1550), ('not', 1450), ('you', 1428), ('he', 1339), ('his', 1271), ('be', 1260), ('as', 1192), ('had', 1177), ('with', 1100)]\r\n    \r\n\r\nFor Pride and Prejudice, the words 'the', 'to', 'of', and 'and' were the top four most common words. Sounds about right, not too interesting yet, lets see what happens with 2-grams.\r\n\r\n\r\n    gram2 = dict()\r\n    \r\n    # Populate 2-gram dictionary\r\n    for i in xrange(len(words)-1):\r\n        key = (words[i], words[i+1])\r\n        if gram2.has_key(key):\r\n            gram2[key] += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            gram2[key] = 1\r\n    \r\n    # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least\r\n    gram2 = sorted(gram2.items(), key=lambda (_, count): -count)\r\n    \r\n    # Print top 20 most frequent words\r\n    print gram2[:20]\r\n\r\n    [(('of', 'the'), 491), (('to', 'be'), 445), (('in', 'the'), 397), (('i', 'am'), 303), (('mr', 'darcy'), 273), (('to', 'the'), 268), (('of', 'her'), 261), (('it', 'was'), 251), (('of', 'his'), 235), (('she', 'was'), 212), (('she', 'had'), 205), (('had', 'been'), 200), (('it', 'is'), 194), (('i', 'have'), 188), (('to', 'her'), 179), (('that', 'he'), 177), (('could', 'not'), 167), (('he', 'had'), 166), (('and', 'the'), 165), (('for', 'the'), 163)]\r\n    \r\n\r\nIt looks like `\"of the\"` and `\"to be\"` are the top two most common 2-grams, sounds good. \r\n\r\n## Next word prediction\r\nWhat can we do with this? Well lets see what happens if we take a random word from all the words, and build a sentence by just choosing the most common pair that has that word as it's start.\r\n\r\n\r\n    start_word = words[len(words)/4]\r\n    print start_word\r\n\r\n    enough\r\n    \r\n\r\nI just went ahead and chose the word that appears $1/4$ of the way into words, random enough.\r\n\r\nNow in a loop, iterate through the frequency list (most frequent first) and see if it matches the first word in a pair, if so, the next word is the second element in the word pair, and continue with that word. Stop after N words or the list does not contain that word.\r\n\r\n    *Note* : gram2 is a list that contains (key,value) where key is a word pair (first, second),\r\n             so you need element[0][0] for first word and element [0][1] for second word\r\n\r\n\r\n    def get2GramSentence(word, n = 50):\r\n        for i in xrange(n):\r\n            print word,\r\n            # Find Next word\r\n            word = next((element[0][1] for element in gram2 if element[0][0] == word), None)\r\n            if not word:\r\n                break\r\n    \r\n    word = start_word\r\n    print \"Start word: %s\" % word\r\n    \r\n    print \"2-gram sentence: \\\"\",\r\n    get2GramSentence(word, 20)\r\n    print \"\\\"\"\r\n\r\n    Start word: enough\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" enough to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much \"\r\n    \r\n\r\nIt gets stuck in a loop pretty much straight away. Not very interesting, try out other words and see what happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n    for word in ['and', 'he', 'she', 'when', 'john', 'never', 'i', 'how']:\r\n        print \"Start word: %s\" % word\r\n    \r\n        print \"2-gram sentence: \\\"\",\r\n        get2GramSentence(word, 20)\r\n        print \"\\\"\"\r\n\r\n    Start word: and\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" and the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the \"\r\n    Start word: he\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" he had been so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much \"\r\n    Start word: she\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" she was not be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so \"\r\n    Start word: when\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" when she was not be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be \"\r\n    Start word: john\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" john with the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of the whole of \"\r\n    Start word: never\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" never be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as \"\r\n    Start word: i\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am sure i am \"\r\n    Start word: how\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" how much as to be so much as to be so much as to be so much as to be \"\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Weighted random choice based on frequency\r\nSame thing. Okay, lets randomly choose from the subset of all 2grams that matches the first word, using a weighted-probability based on counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    import random\r\n    def weighted_choice(choices):\r\n       total = sum(w for c, w in choices)\r\n       r = random.uniform(0, total)\r\n       upto = 0\r\n       for c, w in choices:\r\n          if upto + w > r:\r\n             return c\r\n          upto += w\r\n        \r\n    def get2GramSentenceRandom(word, n = 50):\r\n        for i in xrange(n):\r\n            print word,\r\n            # Get all possible elements ((first word, second word), frequency)\r\n            choices = [element for element in gram2 if element[0][0] == word]\r\n            if not choices:\r\n                break\r\n            \r\n            # Choose a pair with weighted probability from the choice list\r\n            word = weighted_choice(choices)[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n    for word in ['and', 'he', 'she', 'when', 'john', 'never', 'i', 'how']:\r\n        print \"Start word: %s\" % word\r\n    \r\n        print \"2-gram sentence: \\\"\",\r\n        get2GramSentenceRandom(word, 20)\r\n        print \"\\\"\"\r\n\r\n    Start word: and\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" and laughed the party we do not care of sense of you so far differ from the younger boys were \"\r\n    Start word: he\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" he will probably been her relations was not by letting her fine i do you do not write again caroline \"\r\n    Start word: she\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" she could not fetched them purposely kept from the tone is fifty after a servant who do it was indeed \"\r\n    Start word: when\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" when they descended on the rest of poor regiment where he takes part of hunsford every glance from making two \"\r\n    Start word: john\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" john told me was as you would not but whatever might not hope she had passed it so i have \"\r\n    Start word: never\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" never exert himself the only be acceptable to my pretensions whatever manner that she had been hurt by miss bingley \"\r\n    Start word: i\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" i had ever be considered her former way said lydia had she yes ma am only shows some part of \"\r\n    Start word: how\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" how to your success and fearful of sense of importance in their income as his favour of it was not \"\r\n    \r\n\r\n**Now that's way more interesting!** Those are starting to look like sentences!\r\n\r\n    *Note* It's pretty interesting to see that for the sentence \" when he believed him from the amiable but mrs hurst s being ill of being the discussion of course of \", we have hurst s, which we can tell came from Hurst's, an artifact of our stripping away all punctuation but keeping the s.\r\n\r\nLet's try a longer sentence\r\n\r\n\r\n    word = 'it'\r\n    print \"Start word: %s\" % word\r\n    print \"2-gram sentence: \\\"\",\r\n    get2GramSentenceRandom(word, 50)\r\n    print \"\\\"\"\r\n\r\n    Start word: it\r\n    2-gram sentence: \" it impossible not well inquire replied jane one communication of them only hear that she quitted the hope that he started and all what can never look at least if you he had ended only consider that it aloud if a comfort of her to be in paragraph e or \"\r\n    \r\n\r\nPretty cool, lets see what happens when we go to N-grams above 2.\r\n## Tri-grams and more\r\nOkay, let's create a Ngram generator that can let us make ngrams of arbitrary sizes\r\n\r\n\r\n    def generateNgram(n=1):\r\n        gram = dict()\r\n        \r\n        # Some helpers to keep us crashing the PC for now\r\n        assert n > 0 and n < 20\r\n        \r\n        # Populate N-gram dictionary\r\n        for i in xrange(len(words)-(n-1)):\r\n            key = tuple(words[i:i+n])\r\n            if gram.has_key(key):\r\n                gram[key] += 1\r\n            else:\r\n                gram[key] = 1\r\n    \r\n        # Turn into a list of (word, count) sorted by count from most to least\r\n        gram = sorted(gram.items(), key=lambda (_, count): -count)\r\n        return gram\r\n    \r\n    trigram = generateNgram(3)\r\n    # Print top 20 most frequent ngrams\r\n    print trigram[:20]\r\n\r\n    [(('i', 'do', 'not'), 62), (('i', 'am', 'sure'), 62), (('project', 'gutenberg', 'tm'), 57), (('as', 'soon', 'as'), 55), (('she', 'could', 'not'), 50), (('that', 'he', 'had'), 37), (('in', 'the', 'world'), 34), (('it', 'would', 'be'), 34), (('i', 'am', 'not'), 32), (('i', 'dare', 'say'), 31), (('the', 'project', 'gutenberg'), 31), (('could', 'not', 'be'), 30), (('it', 'was', 'not'), 30), (('that', 'he', 'was'), 29), (('mr', 'darcy', 's'), 29), (('that', 'it', 'was'), 28), (('on', 'the', 'subject'), 28), (('as', 'well', 'as'), 27), (('would', 'have', 'been'), 27), (('of', 'mr', 'darcy'), 27)]\r\n    \r\n\r\nCool!

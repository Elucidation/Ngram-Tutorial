<p>First I'll see how far I can get with N-grams without outside resources</p>
<p>We have a text file for <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342">Pride and Prejudice from Project Gutenberg</a> stored as <code>pg1342.txt</code> in the same folder as our notebook. Let's load the text to a string since it's only 701KB, which will fit in memory nowadays.</p>

<pre><code>*Note* : If we wanted to be more memory efficient we should parse the text file and store per word, etc.</code></pre>
